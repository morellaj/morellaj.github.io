{"character":{"I.1":{"order":"1","title":"Hurting Others","description":"Few events are as shocking and panic-inducing for parents as when our rage-filled child hurts another kid. We feel an urgent need to prevent it from ever happening and worry about what might happen if we don't do something to stop this behavior. Is there something wrong with my child? Is this violent behavior going to continue through the school years? Could this result in violence as an adult? Is my child's future in danger if I don't do something significant to fix this problem now? Fortunately the answer to all these questions is almost certainly no. Hurting others is a normal part of growing up. Almost every child does it at some point, and most kids stop hurting others on their own. By panicking and resorting to yellling, punishment, or worst of all spanking, we can make the situation worse and halt our child's learning. Instead, when kids hurt each other we should focus on comforting both children and helping them recover emotionally. When feelings are stable, we can help kids reflect on what happened. In addition, we can use resources like books and shows to help kids consider how to handle these situations before they happen.","activities":{"1":{"order":"1","title":"Day on the Beach","subtitle":"Story about Hurting Others","description":"Kate gets angry when Tom takes a shell that she was after.
